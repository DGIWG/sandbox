== Introduction to GitHub
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

== Working on an existing repository
This first use case is useful when you want to collaborate to an existing project. That is the case for the DGIWG activity. In this case, the workflow is

* Go to the DGIWG project/repository you want to work on.
* Fork the project to your account, so you have your own version.
* Clone on your machine your version.
* Edit file.
* Save file.
* Commit locally.
* push to Fork.
